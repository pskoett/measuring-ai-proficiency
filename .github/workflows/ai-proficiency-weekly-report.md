# Weekly AI Proficiency Report

Generate a weekly report tracking the repository's AI coding proficiency and context engineering maturity over time.

## Assessment Process

### Step 1: Install the Tool

```bash
pip install measure-ai-proficiency
```

### Step 2: Run Full Assessment

```bash
measure-ai-proficiency --format json --output proficiency-report.json
measure-ai-proficiency --format markdown --output proficiency-report.md
```

### Step 3: Check for Historical Data

Look for a previous proficiency tracking file at `.ai-proficiency/history.json`. If it exists, read it to compare with previous assessments.

### Step 4: Analyze Trends

If historical data exists, calculate:
- Level change since last week
- Score change since last week
- New files added
- Files removed

### Step 5: Generate Recommendations

Based on the current level (1-8), provide 3 specific, actionable recommendations:

**For Level 1 (Zero AI):**
- Create a CLAUDE.md with project overview
- Add .cursorrules for Cursor users
- Document basic architecture in README

**For Level 2 (Basic Instructions):**
- Add ARCHITECTURE.md with system design
- Create CONVENTIONS.md with coding standards
- Document API in API.md

**For Level 3 (Comprehensive Context):**
- Set up .claude/commands/ for custom workflows
- Add MEMORY.md for persistent learnings
- Create skills in .claude/skills/

**For Level 4 (Skills & Automation):**
- Define specialized agents in .github/agents/
- Create MCP configuration files
- Set up orchestration workflows

**For Level 5+ (Multi-Agent and beyond):**
- Implement Beads memory system
- Set up cross-repo shared context
- Create governance and scheduling policies

### Step 6: Create Weekly Report Issue

Create a new GitHub issue with the title: `Weekly AI Proficiency Report - [DATE]`

Use this format:

```markdown
## Weekly AI Proficiency Report

**Report Date:** [Current Date]
**Repository:** [Repo Name]

### Current Status

| Metric | This Week | Last Week | Change |
|--------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| **Level** | X | Y | +/-Z |
| **Score** | XX.X | YY.Y | +/-Z.Z |
| **Total Files** | XX | YY | +/-Z |

### Level Breakdown

| Level | Coverage | Files |
|-------|----------|-------|
| Level 1: Zero AI | XX% | N files |
| Level 2: Basic Instructions | XX% | N files |
| Level 3: Comprehensive Context | XX% | N files |
| Level 4: Skills & Automation | XX% | N files |
| Level 5: Multi-Agent Ready | XX% | N files |
| Level 6: Fleet Infrastructure | XX% | N files |
| Level 7: Agent Fleet | XX% | N files |
| Level 8: Custom Orchestration | XX% | N files |

### Recent Changes

[List any context engineering files added/modified this week based on git log]

### This Week's Recommendations

1. **[Most impactful]**: [Specific action]
2. **[Second priority]**: [Specific action]
3. **[Third priority]**: [Specific action]

```

### Step 7: Update History File

If you have write access, update `.ai-proficiency/history.json` with the current assessment data point including date, level, score, and file counts.

## Important Guidelines

- Always be encouraging about progress, no matter how small
- Focus on actionable next steps, not criticism
- If level increased, celebrate the improvement
- If level decreased (rare), investigate what files were removed
- Keep the issue concise and scannable
