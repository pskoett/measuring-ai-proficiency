# .ai-proficiency.yaml
# Configuration for the measure-ai-proficiency project itself
#
# This file serves dual purposes:
# 1. Configure how the tool measures THIS repository
# 2. Serve as a real-world example for users of the tool
#
# Generated using the customize-measurement skill

# AI tools in use for this project
# Auto-detection would find these, but explicit is clearer
tools:
  - claude-code
  - github-copilot

# Custom file locations
# This project uses standard names, so no custom mappings needed
# Example of what this could look like:
# documentation:
#   architecture: "docs/SYSTEM_DESIGN.md"
#   conventions: "CODING_STANDARDS.md"

# Level thresholds (adjusted for smaller project)
# Lower thresholds make it easier to advance levels
thresholds:
  level_3: 10   # Comprehensive Context (default: 15)
  level_4: 8    # Skills & Automation (default: 12)
  level_5: 10   # Multi-Agent Ready (default: 10)
  level_6: 8    # Fleet Infrastructure (default: 8)
  level_7: 6    # Agent Fleet (default: 6)
  level_8: 5    # Custom Orchestration (default: 5)

# No recommendations skipped - this project demonstrates all features

# No focus areas - show all recommendations for template purposes
# focus_areas:
#   - documentation

# Skip validation warnings for documentation example patterns
# This repo is a meta-tool that documents patterns, so our docs contain
# many example file references that don't exist in THIS repo

# Quality scoring thresholds (using defaults)
# Uncomment to customize:
# quality:
#   max_file_size: 100000       # Max bytes to scan for cross-refs
#   min_substantive_bytes: 100  # Min bytes for file to count
#   word_threshold_partial: 50  # Words for partial quality points
#   word_threshold_full: 200    # Words for full quality points
#   git_timeout: 5              # Git command timeout in seconds
